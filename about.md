My name is David Mendoza and I’m a data visualization journalist. That means I use [maps](https://mic.com/articles/121326/evolution-of-same-sex-marriage-in-america) and [charts](https://mic.com/articles/122955/evolution-of-marijuana-legalization-in-america) to explain the news.

Recently, I served as a front-end developer for Hack Oregon, a non-profit that builds civic data projects. As part of the production team, I created [multiple](https://hackoregon.github.io/civic/iframe.html?selectedKind=PathMap&selectedStory=With%20tooltip) [reusable](https://hackoregon.github.io/civic/iframe.html?selectedKind=IconMap&selectedStory=With%20tooltip) [map](https://hackoregon.github.io/civic/iframe.html?selectedKind=ScatterPlotMap&selectedStory=With%20tooltip) [components](https://hackoregon.github.io/civic/iframe.html?selectedKind=ScreenGridMap&selectedStory=Simple%20usage) using deck.gl, Mapbox GL JS, and React. I also helped launch the [Civic Sandbox](http://civicplatform.org/sandbox), an interactive mapping tool for geospatial analysis.

Named after my uncle’s [mediocre batting average](https://www.mlb.com/cut4/how-did-the-mendoza-line-become-an-mlb-term/c-277392972), The Mendoza Line is my news blog where I publish sharp, data-driven reporting about current events. Numerate readers who are tired of frivolous journalism will appreciate my meticulously researched and astutely designed work. I cover mostly crime, demographic, and health statistics, but also offer insights about how to design excellent data visualizations.

I welcome people sharing and even adapting my work. However, you must provide attribution and link to the original post. My work has been featured by [The Advocate](https://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2014/06/05/majority-same-sex-couples-can-now-marry-us), [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/more-data-analysts-went-looking-for-the-south-and-midwest-and-heres-what-they-found/), [ThinkProgress](https://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/02/17/3750335/all-the-arguments-against-obama-nominating-the-next-supreme-court-justice-debunked/), [Upworthy](https://www.upworthy.com/10-years-of-social-change-in-1-simple-gif), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2014/6/19/5824390/the-measles-vaccine-works-in-one-chart), and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/05/22/the-rapid-rise-of-the-career-politician-in-2-gifs/).

I have also [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HBdn7kj9K3Lm1JU9EqL6qYO6xnsLlrccLpw8b6yV3fg/present#slide=id.p) about why journalists should start incorporating more data visualizations into their work at [Health Journalism 2016](http://healthjournalism.org/secondarypage-details.php?id=1618), the annual conference held by the Association of Health Care Journalists.
